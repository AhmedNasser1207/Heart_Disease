Heart Disease Prediction Pipeline ‚ù§Ô∏è
üìñ Overview
This repository contains a complete, end-to-end machine learning project for predicting the presence of heart disease based on the [UCI Heart Disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease).

The project follows a structured pipeline, from initial data cleaning and exploratory analysis to model training, hyperparameter tuning, and final deployment as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

‚ú® Project Workflow
The project is broken down into a series of steps, with each step documented in its own Jupyter Notebook:

Data Preprocessing & Cleaning: Loading the dataset, handling missing values, performing data type conversions, and encoding categorical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Creating visualizations like heatmaps and histograms to understand feature distributions and relationships.

Feature Engineering: Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and using Random Forest feature importance to identify the most impactful predictors.

Model Training & Evaluation: Training and evaluating multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM) to establish baseline performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the best-performing classification model using GridSearchCV to maximize its predictive accuracy.

Model Deployment: Saving the final, tuned model and creating an interactive web UI with Streamlit for real-time predictions.
